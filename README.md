# HW1_CodeRefractor

# Description

This code has been refactored from a code that did not have any sematic elements. The goal was to switch out the divs in the html file with sematic elements that were comparable. When doing this the CSS file also needed to be updated. There were also some CSS elements that could be consolidated. All this needed to be done while still having the same output on the webiste. 

# Installation

For this assignment we needed to create a git hub repo to contain the assignment. Once that repo has been cloned to your local machine you need to create an index.html and make sure that it is at the root. Also you will need to make sure that all the necessary images are located in the correct file so that you do not get any errors when trying to load the page. 

You will need a terminal to be able to pull, add, commit and push your work to your repo. Lastly you need to have an application like Visual Studio Code so that you can work on your code and a good habit in my opinion is to check your webpage as you make changes so that if you make a change that messes up your code you are more likely to be able to figure out where you went wrong in your code.
